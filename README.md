# Getting Started With Python

This repository contains some basic information to help you get started using
Python.  It covers how you can install Python on your computer, how to 
use a Jupyter notebook and Spyder, and basic information about Python and Python data
types.

First, review the Installation information to install Python on your computer
if you have not already done so.  Then, decide how you would like to view the
Python material.  
1. With Interactive Jupyter Notebooks
    * If you are using Anaconda, read the Starting Jupyter Notebooks topic
    * For other Python installations, start Jupyter Notebooks as needed
    * Open the "intro_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb" file to get basic information
        on using a Jupyter notebook.
2. With a Python script and the Markdown files
    * If you are using Anaconda, read the Getting Started With Spyder topic to
        learn how to write and run Python in the Spyder IDE.
    * For other Python installations, write your code in your favorite text/
        code editor and then execute Python accordingly.

Then, use either the Jupyter Notebook files or the Markdown files to review
the Python Primer and Python Data Types topics.

## NumPy and Matplotlib

NumPy is a scientific computing package that allows for more advanced math and
the use of multidimensional arrays.  Matplotlib is a graphing package.  
Jupyter notebooks to introduce these packages can be found at 
[numpy_demo.ipynb](numpy_demo.ipynb) and [matplotlab_demo.ipynb](matplotlib_demo.ipynb).

## Other Python Learning Resources

There is a wide variety of learning options for Python on-line.  For a detailed
intro, there is a Python Essentials Training on LinkedIn Learning accessible
for free through Duke.  

* [Python Essential Training (LinkedIn Learning)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-14898805)

I find the W3 School tutorials a great introduction to syntax.  It isn't as
great for beginning programmers.

Another short learning page that provides some additional examples similar to
my Python Primer and Python Data Types can be found here:

Finally, if none of these suit your needs, you can check out a larger list I
have from my BME 547 site:
