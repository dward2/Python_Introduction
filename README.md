# Getting Started With Python

This repository contains some basic information to help you get started using
Python.  It covers how you can install Python on your computer, how to 
use a Jupyter notebook and Spyder, and basic information about Python and Python data
types.

First, review the Installation information to install Python on your computer
if you have not already done so.  Then, decide how you would like to view the
Python material.  
1. With Interactive Jupyter Notebooks
    * If you are using Anaconda, read the Starting Jupyter Notebooks topic
    * For other Python installations, start Jupyter Notebooks as needed
    * Open the "intro_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb" file to get basic information
        on using a Jupyter notebook.
2. With a Python script and the Markdown files
    * If you are using Anaconda, read the Getting Started With Spyder topic to
        learn how to write and run Python in the Spyder IDE.
    * For other Python installations, write your code in your favorite text/
        code editor and then execute Python accordingly.

Then, use either the Jupyter Notebook files or the Markdown files to review
the Python Primer and Python Data Types topics.
