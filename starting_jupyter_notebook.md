# Starting a Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda

The instructions below will help you start a Jupyter Notebook.  If you are
unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, please follow the instructions below and
open the file `intro_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb`.

**Option 1:**
1. Start Anaconda Navigator
2. Look for the tile called "Jupyter Notebook" and click on the Launch button.
3. Your default browser should open up and display a file tree.  
4. Navigate through the tree until you find the Jupyter Notebook of interest.  
    Jupyter Notebook files have the extension `*.ipynb`.
5. Click on the Jupyter Notebook of interest.  A new browser tab should open
    and display the notebook.

**Option 2:**
1. Start the Jupyter Notebook app directly (for example, from the Windows
    Start menu)
2. A command window will open and eventually your default browser should open
    up and display a file tree.
3. Follow steps 3 and higher above.

**Option 3:**

Depending on how your operating system is set up, directly opening the 
Jupyter Notebook file may open up the appropriate program for using the
Jupyter Notebook.  If not, please use one of the options above.
