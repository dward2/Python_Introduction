## Python Installation
You have a variety of options for how to run Python on your computer.  If you 
have never used Python before, I suggest option 1 below.

1. The easiest way to get started, and the way that most Duke students first
    use Python is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
    Anaconda will install Python and all the major packages that you will
    likely use.  This installation will include [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/),
    an integrated development environment (IDE) for use with Anaconda Python.
    You can use Spyder to write and run your code.
2. If you want more flexibility and a more powerful editor/developer
    environment, you could consider using 
    [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and installing the
    [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).
    This will require you to install Python yourself on your computer.  Full
    instructions for installing Visual Studio Code, Python, and the Python
    extension can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-visual-studio-code-and-the-python-extension).
    This method will require you to manage packges yourself.
3. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) is a professional-caliber
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  If you are comfortable using
    IDEs and want the most versatile/powerful experience, consider this
    option.  At <https://www.jetbrains.com/student/>, you can apply for an
    educational license to the professional version of PyCharm  using your 
    `duke.edu` e-mail.  
4. Finally, you can run Python from the command line by installing Python
   (visit <https://www.python.org/downloads/>) and use whatever text/code editor
    you would like.

## Installing Anaconda
1. Visit <https://www.anaconda.com/download>.
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system.
3. Run the downloaded installer if it doesn't start automatically.
4. Step through the installation steps using the recommended settings.

Instructions for getting started with Spyder can be found 
[here](spyder_getting_started.md).
